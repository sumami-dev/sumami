//! What does DuckDB do when there is more than one connection?
//!
//! This is the measurement behind the design in `service/src/pool.rs`: the DuckDB
//! backend uses **one** connection, because a second one is not safe. The three
//! facts it shows:
//!
//! 1. A connection that queried **before** a write never sees that write — not
//!    even after a checkpoint.
//! 2. A connection opened **after** the write sees it — but stops seeing it when
//!    the older connection is closed.
//! 3. Closing that older connection makes the write invisible again — but
//!    nothing is lost: after a restart the rows are there.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --example snapshot_probe -p sumami-service
//! ```
